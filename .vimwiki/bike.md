Yoo 200 euro is so cheap for a brand new bike don't be τσιγκούνης. Just kidding xddd but I couldn't find any with thin wheels. All cheap ones are mountain or city bikes which is not perfeqt but ok I think.
So here are the ones I found:
1. https://www.decathlon.fr/p/velo-vtt-st-50-noir-26/_/R-p-310069?mc=8561304&c=NOIR
this is like mountain bike, it's 230 euros, has 3*7 gears but I don't love this one because I don't like suspension for no reason at all. I just don't like the look of suspension
2. https://www.decathlon.fr/p/velo-tout-chemin-riverside-120-gris-metal/_/R-p-300806?mc=8405304&c=GRIS
 This is the cheapest one that has gears and is for adults in decathlon. But lookwise it's my fav. Turquoise one looks great I think. 200 euros but it has gears only in the back so it's 1*8 which is not perfeqt but ok.
3. https://www.intersport.fr/noir-vtt_adulte_cliff_600-nakamura-p-YA60K9~AKU/
This is almost the same with number 1. 220 euros, 3*7 gears, has suspension. I would prefer 1 over this bcs decathlon is more trustworthy than this brand I think but I'm not sure.
4. https://www.decathlon.fr/p/velo-route-homme-cyclotourisme-rc100/_/R-p-305831?mc=8545769
Lastly there is this. This is way out of your price range but this is the cheapest one that has thin wheels. And also the first 3 are 15 kg and this is 11 kg. These 2 things makes huge difference on the efficiency of the bike(much less effort for the same distance). 350 euro, 1*7 gears, curved handlebar which is also better I think but I don't know if you like them.
I checked some other french stores but they're all much more expensive. I didn't check 2nd hand bcs if I remember right you wanted a brandnew one. If u r ok with secondhand I can also check them.
End of presentation. Thank u for listening. Any questions or comments?
