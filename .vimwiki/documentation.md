- Added documentation for the JWK environment variables
- Added an example about rolling update of the keys

Note: At first I thought about adding it to the JWK page at the Getting Started section but I thought it would be so much details for the "Getting Started" section so I did a seperate page and added the link to there. If you would prefer otherwise I can merge the 2 pages.
